# Codeschool vim colors

This is a fork of [brettof86s][] port of the [codeschool colorscheme][] with a few personal tweaks for vim mode. The primary reason for this was because, while mvim looked fantastic, vim colors did not translate very well. My solution was to tweak a few of the colors, and then leave it up to you to alter the terminal background color to match the dark blue-ish background you can't get with 256 colors. 

You can install with [vundle][].
